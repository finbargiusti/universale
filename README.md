# Free and For Sale Web App
Welcome to the repository of CS326 Team H. For the semester project we plan on creating a web app for the famous facebook group "Free and For Sale". This app is exclusive to the 5 college consortium and hopes to make the features of the group accessible to everyone in the 5 college consortium whether the user is on facebook or not.
The only pre-requisite to access the web app is to have a 5 college email ID.

## Purpose
Besides being a project for a compsci class, there was another underlying motivation to build this app. Being a college student, there is always a time when one needs to get rid of their previous course books or furniture and make money off of them. Ofcourse all UMass students would be aware of the famous group called'Free and For Sale' and even other groups for doing this. But what if someone in another college nearby gave you a better deal on that calculus textbook, or was offering a wooden shelf for free, or a table fan for rent ? What if someone wasn't on facebook for some reason and had the desire to seel and buy products without burning a hole in his/her pocket? Keeping all this in mind, we came up with a common solution : A web app for Free and For sale for the 5 college consortium exclusively. It doesn't end there, it may not necessarily be a material object, could be tutoring sessions, dancing lessons, driving tutorials and so much more! The possibilities are endless!
