# Free and For Sale Web App
Welcome to the repository of CS326 Team H. For the semester project we plan on creating a web app for the famous facebook group "Free and For Sale". This app is exclusive to the 5 college consortium and hopes to make the features of the group accessible to everyone in the 5 college consortium whether the user is on facebook or not.
The only pre-requisite to access the web app is to have a 5 college email ID.

The UI includes :
* Landing page - Search Bar and Feed [Semi Private]  
* Login Popup
* Post-Login Page [Similar to main page but now displays details]
* Profile Page
* Flagged Items page
* Chat Box {Optional}
